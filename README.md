# Fundamental Models and Algorithms in Bioinformatics

This is the code repository for the "Fundamental Models and Algorithms" class, offered at Indiana University under the course listing CSCI B490.
This repository will be the primary means by which we both disseminate information about class coding assignments and assess your performance on those assignments.

## Assignments / Projects
There will be a single coding project associated with each unit in the course (6 units total).
For each project, we will provide a detailed description of the deliverables (by way of a README file) and, if necessary, and associated data files or skeleton code.
As individuals or groups, you  will maintain "forks" of this repository in which you implement your solutions to the assignments.
You will be expected to follow assignment instructions *precisely* to facilitate the instructors' assessment of your work.

Not all project descriptions will be available at the beginning of the semester.
We will provide notifications as these descriptions become available, at which point you can syncronize your personal/group repository with the master repository to access the descriptions.
